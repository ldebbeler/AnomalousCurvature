branch: genericOneLoop
Features of this branch:
- linear radial dispersion, arbitrary exponent in tangential dispersion (dummy.cpp)
- bare polarization bubble
- real frequencies
- frequency dependence of imaginary part self energy (frequencyDep.cpp, freq.sh)
- frequency and momentum dependence of imaginary part
- momentum dependence of real part self energy (momenta.sh): not required for physical conclusions. Does not work very well
