Features of this project:
- linear radial dispersion, arbitrary exponent in tangential dispersion 
- bare polarization bubble
- real frequencies
- frequency dependence of imaginary part self energy 
- frequency and momentum dependence of imaginary part
- momentum dependence of real part self energy (momenta.sh): not required for physical conclusions. Does not work very well
